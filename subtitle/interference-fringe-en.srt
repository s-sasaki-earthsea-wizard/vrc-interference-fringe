00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,540
Hello everyone. Today we present "The Power of Physics Eyes: Interference Fringes" - from soap bubbles' rainbows, we can see atoms, earthquakes, and gravity.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,400
A video with this somewhat mysterious title that explores the amazing power of interference fringes.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,620
Now everyone, you've blown soap bubbles before, right?

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:28,439
Those beautiful rainbow-colored patterns that shimmer - actually, using exactly the same principle, we can see invisible atomic arrangements and ground movements from earthquakes.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,619
And even gravitational waves coming from space.

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,240
Today we'll introduce you to this mysterious world of interference fringes.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,540
Let's start with a phenomenon called Newton's rings.

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,300
Some of you might have seen this in science class experiments.

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,940
When you place a flat convex lens on a glass plate,

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,199
beautiful concentric ring patterns appear spreading from the center.

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,020
These are Newton's rings.

12
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,120
Why do such patterns form?

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,460
Light reflects in the thin air layer between the lens and glass.

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,860
Light reflected from the upper surface and light reflected from the lower surface overlap,

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,540
causing a phenomenon called interference.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,479
What's interesting here is why they form beautiful concentric circles.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,300
Actually, the air layer thickness d has this relationship with the distance r from the center.

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,960
The air layer thickness equals the radius squared divided by twice the lens's radius of curvature.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,320
In other words, the farther from the center, the thicker the air layer becomes.

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,440
This change in thickness creates the beautiful concentric patterns.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,339
Why do bright and dark regions form?

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,620
This is due to the wave nature of light.

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,260
When the optical path difference - the difference in distance traveled by two light rays -

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
equals exactly an integer multiple of the light's wavelength,

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,400
the waves reinforce each other and become bright.

26
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,420
Conversely, at positions offset by half a wavelength,

27
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,680
the waves cancel each other out and become dark.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,340
Imagine waves in a pool.

29
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,179
If two waves perfectly overlap,

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,020
they create a large wave. If peaks and troughs overlap, they flatten out.

31
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,000
It's the same principle.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,720
Now here's the really amazing part.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,440
The ring radius is about 5mm or so - easily measurable with a ruler, right?

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,460
But what about the air layer thickness?

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,340
Let's actually calculate it.

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,279
For example, if the ring radius is 5mm

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,460
and the lens radius of curvature is 1 meter,

38
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,160
the air layer thickness is about 12.5 micrometers!

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,260
That's about one-fifth the thickness of a human hair.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,180
So from visible 5mm fringe patterns,

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,880
we can determine invisible 12.5 micrometer

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,499
ultra-fine thicknesses!

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,220
This is the magic of interference fringes.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,400
It's nature's amplification device that shows us invisible things magnified hundreds to thousands of times.

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,880
And soap bubble rainbows work on exactly the same principle.

46
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,920
However, the difference from Newton's rings is

47
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,920
that the medium changes from air to a thin soap film,

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,460
and the shape becomes irregular patterns instead of concentric circles.

49
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,619
The soap bubble film thickness varies by location.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,160
And depending on the film thickness, places where 700nm red light reinforces

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,980
differ from places where 450nm blue light reinforces,

52
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:01,060
which is why those beautiful rainbow colors appear.

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,660
Now here's the main topic.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,959
In 1912, a scientist named Max von Laue

55
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,900
discovered that X-rays diffract when directed at crystals.

56
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,560
What's amazing about this is

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,739
that it was the moment humanity first became able to see atomic arrangements.

58
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,900
In X-ray diffraction, Bragg's law becomes important.

59
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,260
It sounds complicated, but the principle is simple.

60
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,979
Atoms in crystals are arranged regularly,

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,520
and when the path difference of X-rays reflected from each layer

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,300
equals an integer multiple of the wavelength,

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,680
the X-rays reinforce each other.

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,860
Same principle as soap bubbles.

65
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,820
In actual measurements, we first record diffraction patterns

66
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,720
and investigate at which angles X-rays become strong.

67
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,399
Then using Bragg's equation, we calculate interatomic distances

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
and ultimately reveal how atoms are arranged -

69
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,940
their three-dimensional structure.

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,840
X-ray diffraction is actually used in many places.

71
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,420
New material development, geological surveys,

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,400
and interestingly,

73
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,300
in art authentication too - analyzing pigment components

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,500
to distinguish authentic from fake

75
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,759
or estimate when paintings were created.

76
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,080
Next is InSAR. The formal name is Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar.

77
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,200
In Japanese, it's called synthetic aperture radar interferometry.

78
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,900
This is a technology for measuring ground deformation from satellites.

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,300
The mechanism works like this:

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,820
The satellite emits radio waves toward the ground and observes the same location again after some time.

81
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,480
If the ground has moved due to earthquakes or other causes, the distance from the satellite changes, right?

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,240
This distance change is detected as a phase difference between the two observation datasets.

83
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,380
During the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, this technology played a major role.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,540
Amazingly, ground displacement of up to 1 meter - about the height of an adult's waist -

85
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,759
was observed from space.

86
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:36,480
Rainbow-colored interference fringe patterns centered on the epicenter appeared on the ground surface like a giant soap bubble.

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,100
What's amazing about this technology is that within hours of a disaster, we can understand damage conditions over a wide area.

88
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:56,220
We can check conditions in dangerous places where people can't enter, and by continuously observing the same location for years, we can capture slow changes like ground subsidence.

89
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,160
Finally, the ultimate interference technology: gravitational wave detection.

90
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,760
Einstein predicted that when massive objects move, spacetime warps

91
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,540
and this distortion propagates as waves.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,720
But they were too small - for nearly 100 years, no one could actually observe them.

93
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,559
Then on September 14, 2015,

94
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,220
the American research facility LIGO finally succeeded in detecting gravitational waves for the first time.

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,680
They caught gravitational waves from black hole mergers that occurred 1.3 billion light-years away.

96
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,720
It was 99 years after Einstein's prediction.

97
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,600
LIGO is a massive L-shaped device with 4km arms, as shown in this aerial photograph.

98
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,599
Laser light is split into two arms and made to travel back and forth.

99
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:57,100
When gravitational waves pass through, one arm stretches slightly while the other contracts.

100
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,900
This tiny change is detected using a Michelson interferometer.

101
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,180
We're measuring incredibly small lengths,

102
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,540
but the measurement principle is actually very classical and orthodox.

103
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,919
Here's the truly unbelievable part.

104
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,820
The detected displacement is only 10^-18 meters.

105
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,860
That's incredibly small.

106
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,360
To understand how small this is:

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,159
It's one-thousandth the size of a proton, the particle that makes up atomic nuclei.

108
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,560
Comparing to the distance between Earth and the Sun,

109
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,500
it's the size of one hydrogen atom.

110
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,640
If you expanded a hair's thickness to Earth's diameter,

111
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,900
it would barely move 1 millimeter.

112
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,340
It's unimaginably small.

113
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,280
But using the phenomenon of interference, we can measure this!

114
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:03,580
The first detected gravitational wave, called GW150914,

115
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:10,620
was from a phenomenon where energy equivalent to 3 times the Sun's mass was released instantaneously.

116
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,200
To detect displacements far smaller than protons,

117
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,700
various noise countermeasures and interference amplification techniques are used,

118
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,320
but the fundamental principle is the classical Michelson interferometer -

119
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,300
the same light interference as soap bubble rainbows.

120
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,160
What all the technologies we've seen today have in common is interference fringes.

121
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,700
Path differences become phase differences, which appear as interference patterns.

122
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,180
Using this principle, we've visualized invisible things and amplified minute changes.

123
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,420
From the atomic world to global-scale changes,

124
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,800
and even spacetime waves coming from the far reaches of the universe -

125
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,339
we're observing everything using fundamentally the same principle as soap bubble rainbows.

126
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:09,100
Interference fringes are truly a special eye given to physics.

127
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,220
How was that?

128
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,800
Today we've journeyed together through the mysterious world of interference fringes.

129
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,700
The rainbow colors of soap bubbles we blew as children -

130
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,460
using the same principle as those beautiful patterns,

131
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,399
scientists can unravel atomic arrangements

132
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,340
and even capture gravitational waves from space.

133
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,440
Doesn't this change how you see the world?

134
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,160
Next time you see soap bubbles, please stop for a moment and observe them.

135
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,379
Keys to unlocking the universe's secrets might be hidden in those rainbow colors.

136
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,460
Well then everyone, until the next video, farewell.
